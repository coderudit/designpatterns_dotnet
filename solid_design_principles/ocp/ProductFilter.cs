            The use of yield return is significant: it allows the method to return matching products one at a time, as they are found, rather than building and returning a complete list all at once. This approach is memory-efficient, especially for large collections, because it enables deferred executionâ€”the caller receives results as they are produced, rather than waiting for the entire filtering process to complete.

            A potential 'gotcha' is that the method containing this code must have a return type compatible with IEnumerable<Product> (or similar), since yield return is only valid in iterator methods. Also, if the products collection is modified during iteration, it could cause runtime errors.
